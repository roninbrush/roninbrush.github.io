## If looks made a diff

[JSX Looks Like An Abomination - JavaScript Scene - Medium](https://diigo.com/07neti)

> *   JSX is not limited to HTML. You can use it to create arbitrary object trees. Netflix uses that capability to mirror their web app architecture on a wide variety of devices using their own custom object model for TV rendering.
> *   React Native uses it to render device-native UI elements.
> *   React creates a single listener automatically, so you never have to think about event delegation again.

> Designers Don’t Mind JSX

*I don't. Reminds me of xaml. A little off putting at first; but it grows on you; and it's powerful.*

> Inline Styles Are Good

*I agree.*

> *   Putting styles in a React component is more akin to putting styles in a web component than putting styles into raw HTML
> *   you only have to update it in one place, and you don’t have to worry about selector scoping.

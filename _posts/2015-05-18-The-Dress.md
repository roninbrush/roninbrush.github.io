 our brains conclude that the image is lighted by a cool illuminant like
 a blue sky, we will ignore shorter wavelengths and determine that thedress is white and gold. However, if our brains decide that the image is
 being lighted by a warm illuminant like an incandescent light, we willdiscount longer wavelengths in the picture and will see the dress asblue and black.

 they are not yet sure why that would be, their current hypothesis isthat women and older people are more likely to spend their awake timeduring the day, and therefore more likely to assume that their visualworld is contaminated by blue sky

 have in your head an internal model of what the colors of the worldare, and that helps you resolve ambiguities," Conway said. "The machinein your head says, 'Well, given what we know historically, I'm going toassume it is this color, or that color.' "
